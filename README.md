# First_Portfolio_Project_K12_Wf
My first Kentico portfolio project in Kentico 12 webforms. 
This project includes the SLN file for my portfolio website which includes the folders needed to get the project running, a gitIgnore project which prevents github from sending information about my project I don't want sent, the CMS and LIB file for the Content Management system kentico, and this readme file

* A portfolio website is a website that displays information about whoever it is covering, such as their experience, skills, previous work (etc). My portfolio website is based off of kentico 12 in order to help me get comfortable inside the kentico admin userface. 

* My goal with making a portfolio website is to help get my name out there, whether it is for future employers or for those who would need to look up my name to learn more about me, as well as to make myself look more professional.

* Since the goal is to improve employability, I wanted to make sure at some point I could include my experience. To keep a location where I can store my future accomplishments, I created a projects page with dummy items.

* In addition to the project page, I created a linked in link and a mailto link in the footer of the page, two pages all about me, place you can contact me, and a spot for my resume.
