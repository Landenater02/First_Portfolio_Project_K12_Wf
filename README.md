# First_Portfolio_Project_K12_Wf
My first Kentico portfolio project in Kentico 12 webforms
This project includes the SLN file for my portfolio website

* A portfolio website is a website that displays information (experience, skills, previous work etc.) 

* My goal with making a portfolio website is to help get my name out there, whether it is for future employers or for those who would need to look up my name to learn more about me, as well as to make myself look more professional.

* although I am lacking experience, I am learning everyday. To keep a location where I can store my future accomplishments, I created a projects page with dummy items.

* I created a linked in link and a mailto link in the footer of the page, two pages all about me, a place you can contact me and a spot for my resume.
